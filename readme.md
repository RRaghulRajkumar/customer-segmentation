# Mall Customer Segmentation using Clustering
## Overview
Welcome to the "Mall Customer Segmentation" project! This repository contains Python code and Jupyter notebooks for applying clustering techniques to segment customers based on their behavior and spending patterns in a shopping mall. The project aims to gain insights into different customer groups and develop a deeper understanding of their preferences, enabling the mall to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement
The main objective of this project is to cluster mall customers into distinct groups based on their demographics and shopping behavior. The dataset used for clustering contains features such as customer age, annual income, and spending score. The goal is to discover natural groupings within the customer data, identifying segments that exhibit similar characteristics.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises information about mall customers and their spending habits. Each sample in the dataset includes attributes such as customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score. The spending score is a metric assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending patterns.

## Goals
The main goals of this project are as follows:

Data Exploration: Perform an in-depth exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution of features and identify potential patterns among customers.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, remove outliers, and scale features as necessary for clustering.
Feature Selection: Select relevant features for clustering and visualize the data to gain insights.
Clustering Algorithms: Implement popular clustering algorithms, such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, or DBSCAN, to identify customer segments.
Elbow Method: Use the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Cluster Visualization: Visualize the clustered data to interpret and present the results effectively.
Customer Profiling: Analyze the characteristics and behavior of each customer segment to understand their preferences.
Marketing Strategies: Suggest tailored marketing strategies for each customer segment to improve customer engagement and loyalty.
Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset files (if not too large) or links to the dataset source.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, feature selection, clustering, and visualization.
src/: Python scripts containing reusable functions for data processing and clustering implementation.
results/: Saved cluster labels, visualizations, and insights.
report/: A detailed report summarizing the clustering results, customer profiling, and marketing strategy suggestions.
Usage
To run the customer segmentation using clustering on the provided dataset, you will need Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using the requirements.txt file:

## bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
After installing the required libraries, you can use the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to explore the data, preprocess it, apply clustering algorithms, and visualize the results.

## Contributions
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you find any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or want to experiment with different clustering algorithms, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
